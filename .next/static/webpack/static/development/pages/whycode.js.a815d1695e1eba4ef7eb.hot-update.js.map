I like to remain open and curious as to what reveals itself as being interesting, troubling or surprising when coding. As such, coding is not only a constructive practice for me (where the goal is working software), but is as much a practice of knowledge development. I mostly explore concepts related to words, language and literature, and my practice often results in a rough sketch or proof-of-concept – hence I refer to my practice as ‘conceptual software design’'\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    id: 4,\r\n    key: 4,\r\n    thumb: '../static/images/people/AnnKarring.jpg',\r\n    name: 'Ann Karring',\r\n    whyCode: 'To me coding is a way to express myself.

However now, having experienced the potential of computation and creative practices, I highly regard, and seek to understand, the use of code and computation in the art, storytelling and interactive design that I encounter every day. At the same time, code underwrites so many aspects of contemporary digital living – in multifaceted ways. This often makes me cautious and uneasy. It ultimately forces me to consider and reflect on my role as a programmer and the code I can contribute to the rest of the world. Code does matter, and as a student at Digital Design at Aarhus University I have a unique chance to explore meaning and consequences of computation in light of a creative and practical engagement with programming.'\r\n  }  \r\n];\r\n\r\nexport default () => (\r\n  <Layout>\r\n    <Title txt='“Why are you interested in coding?”' />\r\n    <div className=\"WhyCodeWrapper\">\r\n      {whyCodes.map( function(wc, i) {\r\n        return <WhyCodeEntry\r\n          id={wc.id}\r\n          key={wc.key}\r\n          name={wc.name}\r\n          thumb={wc.thumb}\r\n          whyCode={wc.whyCode}\r\n          />\r\n      })}\r\n    </div>\r\n  </Layout>\r\n)"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAEA;AAEA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AALA;AAQA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AALA;AAQA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AALA;AAQA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AALA;AAQA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AALA;AAQA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AALA;AASA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AALA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAOA;AAZA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
