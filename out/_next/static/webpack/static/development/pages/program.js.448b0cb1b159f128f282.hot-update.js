  body: "In this two day workshop Andreja will teach some basic Java programming, investigate the details of the wav and aiff sound file formats—and discuss some approaches to generative music. We'll look into the basics of digital sound—and build our own software application to create generative sound processes using fundamental techniques of computer programming. - No programming experience required (you'll learn on the spot) - No knowledge of music software required (we won't be using any) - No musical background required",
